Micro-animations are small, functional animations that help the user by providing feedback, explaining status, and making the interface feel "alive."

### Why they matter

A well-placed transition can make a website feel premium. It guides the user's eye and provides a sense of continuity as they move through your application.

### Implementing with Tailwind

Tailwind's built-in transition and animation utilities make it easy to add these subtle touches without writing custom CSS.

```html
<button class="transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-105 active:scale-95">
  Click me
</button>
```

### Motion and Emotion

Don't overdo it. The goal is to enhance the experience, not distract from it. Simple fades and slight shifts in position are often more effective than dramatic rotations or bouncing effects.
